        <h2>Tailored experiences for your canine companion</h2>
        <p>Our four-legged friends come in a variety of shapes and sizes, all with different needs and individual personalities. That’s why at The Dog &amp; Boot I like to get to know you and your furry friend, listening to your needs in order to deliver a service that gives peace of mind &amp; happiness for both pet and owner. To do this I offer a meet &amp; greet before any walk or stay, most importantly it gives your four-legged friend time to settle and to make sure you are both comfortable with me and my home.</p>
        <p>Quality time and individual attention for each dog is important, that’s why I aim to keep group walks and boarding to a maximum of 3 dogs at a time depending on size and individual needs of each of your canine companions.</p>
